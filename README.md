# copper_chef

The Copper Chef was the Fourth-Year Design Project for Electrical & Computer Engineering students Eric Bender, Shiva Ehtezazi, Taylor Laekeman, Christian Petri, and Brian Troung, presented in Spring 2018.  The Copper Chef is an automatic steak-cooking device that sits atop a conventional stove and cooks a steak to a selected level of doneness.  This repository contains the source code that is run on the device's Arduino Mega microcontroller, as well as the LaTeX source for the group's final design report.
